# Golang-Projects

Various programs written in Golang from the book [Black Hat Go](https://nostarch.com/blackhatgo) and the site [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/).  Some are the same as the demoes provided and others have been modified for me to be able to practice doing various things in Go.
